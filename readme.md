# Program Highlight

1. The HK Common QR Code used the CRC-16-CCITT to calculate the CRC
2. How to add the additional information such as bill number, purpose of transaction and additional consumer data request, we added the bill number in the example
3. The Error Correcting-Code for the QR code should be “L” because the QR code should be displayed on the monitor.
